Because of the constraints placed on weights in the TrueNorth architecture, TeaLearning focuses instead on learning connections. However, connections are binary values, and cannot be explicitly represented as floating point values. Yepes et al. circumvents this constraint by using both an *effective network* and a *shadow network*. The effective network is what actually gets deployed onto TrueNorth, with binary connections, and the the shadow network is what gets trained during backpropogation. Essentially, the shadow network represents connections as floating point values, and the effective network constrains them by setting connections to 1 if the shadow connections are greater than 0.5, and 0 otherwise. \n","\n","In our implementation, it may be easier to think of it this way: we have a (unconstrained) network in which we are training connections. Connections are stored and updated as floating point values. However, when we feed forward, we will constrain the connections using the constraint outlined above. \n","\n","As such, we will use the following TensorFlow functions to implement the constraints: `tf.round` and `tf.clip_by_value`. We will first round the connections so that they take on integer values, and then clip them between 0 and 1 so they are binary.\n","\n","In order to implement this during backpropogation, we need to worry about the gradients of these functions. In particular, we would like for both of these functions to assumed to have a gradient of 1 so that they don't interfere with our calculations (regardless of their actual differentiability). This behavior is default in TensorFlow for the `clip_by_value` function, but if you try to use `tf.round` during training it will throw an error (because it does not have a defined gradient).\n","\n","We can achieve our desired behavior using `tf.RegisterGradient`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UAj_LsYCCT9K"},"outputs":[],"source":["@tf.RegisterGradient(\"CustomRound\")\n","def _const_round_grad(unused_op, grad):\n","    return grad"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"M0lksVf_CT9L"},"source":["This code tells TensorFlow how to handle the calculation for a custom gradient called \"CustomRound\".

The only parameter that really needs to be defined is the number of neurons in the layer (`units`.)

Because weights are not trained in TeaLearning, they are set to 1 and -1 so as to maximize information transfer. In a similar (but more simple) vein as Esser et al., we alternate between 1 and -1 for each axon.

Now we need to see who spikes. For TeaLearning, neurons are set with a threshold of 0, a floor of 0, and a reset potential of 0. This means that neurons reset to 0 no matter what happens, i.e., they are memoryless. Additionally, they will spike if their potential is greater than or equal to zero. Our network is already memoryless, so all we need to do is add a greater than or equal to operation"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"id":"ek_-uTF-CT9Y","outputId":"2a649c6e-fb64-438d-e492-3b452a080fc3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668559229136,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":340,"user":{"displayName":"Tâm Trần Đức","userId":"06468723492313726316"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["tf.Tensor([[1. 0. 0. 1. 1.]], shape=(1, 5), dtype=float32)\n"]}],"source":["# Cast the output because `tf.greater_equal` returns booleans\n","output = tf.cast(tf.greater_equal(output, 0.0), tf.float32)\n","print(output)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gLsdR6IKCT9Z"},"source":["This is our final output.

During inference, it's fine to just use `tf.greater_equal`, but during training we need something that has a gradient. Following suit of Esser et al., we use the sigmoid function as this approximation. Remember in the initializer when we had the `self.uses_learning_phase = True` line? This is why we need it. During the training phase, we will feed forward using a sigmoid activaiton so that we can use backpropogation. During the test (or validaiton) phase, we will use the `tf.greater_equal` funciton be one-to-one with TrueNorth.\n","\n","Our `call` code should now look pretty straightforward. We replace some `tf` funcitons with `K` functions, which is the Keras backend API.
